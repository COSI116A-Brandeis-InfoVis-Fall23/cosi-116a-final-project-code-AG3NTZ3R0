      Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization,
      taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>,

    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>
      <em>
        We have set out to create an interactive and educational visualization tool that addresses the organizational
        need for a straightforward way to understand the complex relationship of poverty and racial demographics with
        housing inequality in the United States. The tool allows users to explore and compare different household
        conditions through an interactive floor plan with color-coded items which represent income and expenses, thereby
        transforming abstract data into a vivid, tangible experience that powerfully conveys the realities of housing
        inequality.

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      <em>
        Our project uses data from the American Community Survey Supplemental Poverty Measure (ACS SPM) from 2009 to
        2019, focusing on demographics, economics, and housing to understand poverty-related trends. The dataset,
        comprising 47 columns, includes categorical, ordinal, and quantitative types. We aggregated this data into
        averages for each racial demographic, which was crucial for dynamically generating furniture in the floor plan
        of our tool. Specific features from the dataset were selected to represent different furniture pieces,
        illustrating various household conditions. Accompanying the data, a dictionary provided clear explanations of
        each column, enhancing our understanding. Extensive data processing was necessary, revealing patterns and
        trends not immediately visible in the raw data, and aiding in the creation of our visualizations.

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <em>
        Summary of task table.

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <p>
      <em>
        Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      <em>
        In conclusion, our project not only simplifies the complex narrative of housing inequality in the United States
        but also brings it to life through an interactive floor plan. By aggregating and processing extensive ACS SPM
        data, focusing on key demographic and economic aspects, and converting these into tangible, color-coded
        elements representing household conditions, we have created a tool that not only educates but also engages
        users in understanding and exploring the nuances of this critical social issue. This approach transforms
        abstract statistics into a relatable, visual story, making the realities of housing inequality more accessible
        and comprehensible to a broader audience. Our work underscores the power of data visualization in bridging the
        gap between complex data and public understanding, paving the way for more informed discussions and potential
        solutions to this persistent challenge.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
