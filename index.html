    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>
      <em>
        We have set out to create an interactive and educational visualization tool that addresses the organizational
        need for a straightforward way to understand the complex relationship of poverty and racial demographics with
        housing inequality in the United States. The tool allows users to explore and compare different household
        conditions through an interactive floor plan with color-coded items which represent income and expenses, thereby
        transforming abstract data into a vivid, tangible experience that powerfully conveys the realities of housing
        inequality.

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      <em>
        Our project uses data from the American Community Survey Supplemental Poverty Measure (ACS SPM) from 2009 to
        2019, focusing on demographics, economics, and housing to understand poverty-related trends. The dataset,
        comprising 47 columns, includes categorical, ordinal, and quantitative types. We aggregated this data into
        averages for each racial demographic, which was crucial for dynamically generating furniture in the floor plan
        of our tool. Specific features from the dataset were selected to represent different furniture pieces,
        illustrating various household conditions. Accompanying the data, a dictionary provided clear explanations of
        each column, enhancing our understanding. Extensive data processing was necessary, revealing patterns and
        trends not immediately visible in the raw data, and aiding in the creation of our visualizations.
      </em>
    </p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      <em>
        The main task of our visualization is to discover the correlation between housing inequality and poverty trends 
        among diverse racial backgrounds in the United States. We also want to present the impact and variations introduced 
        by other demographic factors on this relationship, particularly on people's housing choices and economic situation. 
        Users are able to derive personalized insights through exploring the nuanced economic dynamics within a unit across
        different demographic and housing scenarios.
      </em>
    </p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    <p>
      <em>
        Our multi-family home view provides an engaging, clear visual representation of the data, with
        a customizable focus. The floor plan view provides a different perspective on the
        data and allows for clear comparisons between trends within different racial demographics. The radar chart view
        displays the six critical dimensions of housing inequality in a dynamic and informative way,
        revealing intersections and variations in inequality within and between the dimensions. Our use of contrasting
        color marks makes it easier to compare the relative values of our data.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        We imagined a floor plan would immediately make the focus of this visualization clear: showing
        the resources a household has on average, when controlling for a key demographic factor. The
        above sketch shows a single household's resources, represented with furniture of various
        sizes and two colours. The size of each item of furniture is relative to the amount of
        financial assets that it represents, while the color it has denotes whether the asset is a source of income or
        an expenditure that household. The only shape with a certain meaning encoded
        is the bed - each one represents one person in a given household, and its shape is relative to
        how much that person earns annually. The idea is each furniture item is a solid color, only
        displaying a small label with the exact numerical value when moused over. Additionally, there is
        a legend that can also be moused over and links each furniture item to the table of values
        by highlighting. (Note: this particular household in the sketch does not receive any subsidies from the government,
        so only their total income is represented with the two beds).

      <em>
        To prepare for peer review, we created a slideshow to present mock interactions with our data. We assigned
        subsidies the color orange to denote a third source of income for households. In our final visualization, we
        made furniture grey when it does not receive that resource at all, and we create a different channel of sized
        marks to denote quantities of finances that a piece of furniture would represent. Here we decided to create multiple
        filtered views across our six dimensions and intended to implement brushing and linking between the furniture,
        the hexagon values, and the calculations pop-ups.

        We received feedback that it was difficult for to discern what our central questions or investigation were meant to
        highlight from the data. We boil down to simpler marks and fewer channels for our final iteration. We hoped to
        show how households struggle, exploring how socioeconomic factors like educational attainment, marriage
        status, homeownership status, poverty level, and state can affect people's livelihoods and perspectives on wealth
        inequality across the country.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      <em>
        In conclusion, our project not only simplifies the complex narrative of housing inequality in the United States
        but also brings it to life through an interactive floor plan. By aggregating and processing extensive ACS SPM
        data, focusing on key demographic and economic aspects, and converting these into tangible, color-coded
        elements representing household conditions, we have created a tool that not only educates but also engages
        users in understanding and exploring the nuances of this critical social issue. This approach transforms
        abstract statistics into a relatable, visual story, making the realities of housing inequality more accessible
        and comprehensible to a broader audience. Our work underscores the power of data visualization in bridging the
        gap between complex data and public understanding, paving the way for more informed discussions and potential
        solutions to this persistent challenge.
